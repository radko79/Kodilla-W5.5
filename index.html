			    	<div class="col-md-8">West Nile virus first appeared in the United States in 1999, when a case was reported in New York City. In the following years, it spread across much of the country and into Canada and the Caribbean. In 2013 it was responsible for 88 American deaths, out of 2,170 reported cases, and its prevalence was expected to grow, as climate change models predicted a lengthening of the mosquito (carrier) season across many areas. The strain of West Nile virus that emerged in the United States matched a virus that had been circulating in Israel and Tunisia. Although asymptomatic in most people, about 20 percent of those who are infected develop flu-like symptoms and less than one percent develop severe neurologic illness, sometimes leading to permanent cognitive and motor deficits or even death.</div>

			    	<div class="col-md-5">The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease, was limited historically to rural Latin America. But increased migration of infected people into urban areas in Mexico and Central and South America—as well as into the United States and other countries, particularly those in Europe—has facilitated the spread of the disease. Chagas disease is transmitted mainly by bloodsucking “kissing bugs,” but various domestic and wild animals, including cats, dogs, guinea pigs, raccoons, skunks, and armadillos, participate in the transmission cycle. Other means of transmission include blood transfusion, placental transmission, or consumption of contaminated food. Chagas disease affects between seven million and eight million people worldwide. And while many of those people may experience no or only mild symptoms, such as headache and swollen lymph glands, others, particularly those who do not receive treatment, experience chronic infection. In the chronic state, the parasites become permanent residents of the heart and digestive muscles, leading to the progressive deterioration of those tissues.</div>

			    	<div class="col-md-9">Chikungunya fever was first recorded in 1952–53 in an outbreak on Africa’s Makonde plateau. Several years later, the disease emerged in Southeast Asia, and in the early 2000s it was detected on islands in the western Indian Ocean. In 2007 it appeared for the first time in Europe, causing illness in more than 200 people in Ravenna, Italy. The virus likely was carried to Ravenna by a person who had recently visited an affected area of India. The outbreak in Europe was unexpected, since the region’s temperate climate was thought to provide a barrier against the invasion of Aedes mosquitoes, which transmit chikungunya virus. Although rarely life-threatening, chikungunya fever can cause severe joint and muscle pain. The contorted posture of its victims is captured in the Kimakonde translation of chikungunya, which means “that which bends up.”</div>

		                <p><span>Sun: </span>Let's start with a softball; the sun would obviously fry you up immediately. "You would vaporize. So that's really fast; not a good place to visit."</p>
		                <p><span>Total time: Less than one second</span></p>
		                <p><span>Mercury: </span>The side that faces the sun is extremely hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit/427 degrees Celsius at its hottest). Conversely, the opposite side is freezing (minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit/minus 179 degrees Celsius at its coldest). If you could straddle the line between the two temperatures and rotate between them, then just maybe "you could survive as long as you could hold your breath."</p>
		                <p><span>Total time: About two minutes</span></p>
		                <p><span>Venus: </span>At 900 degrees Fahrenheit (482 degrees Celsius), you already know this one isn't going to be pretty. "By the way, Venus has about the same gravity as Earth, so you'd be very familiar walking around, until you vaporize."</p>
		                <p><span>Total time: Less than one second.</span></p>
		                <p><span>Earth: </span>Thanks to the wonderful oxygen in our atmosphere, food and water, and everything else that makes our home planet liveable, you can get in a good 80 years here. You may live even longer if you inhabit a "blue zone," one of the several places on Earth where people tend to live much longer than the general population.</p>
		                <p><span>Total time: About 80 years</span></p>
		                <p><span>Mars: </span>"Mars is very cold, but the air is very thin, so the intensity of the cold won't be as biting as it might otherwise feel at that temperature on Earth." With some very, very warm clothing, you could probably walk around on Mars until you couldn't hold your breath any longer. (Ball's in your court to fix that problem, Elon.)</p>
		                <p><span>Total time: About two minutes</span></p>
		                <p><span>Jupiter: </span>Being a gaseous planet, Jupiter would make for a uniquely uncomfortable life. On — or in? — this enormous planet, "you would descend forever into the gaseous atmosphere until you're crushed by the pressure of the planet's layers."</p>
		                <p><span>Total time: Less than one second</span></p>
		                <p><span>Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune: </span>See above. As with Jupiter, you'd descend into these gas giants and ultimately be crushed by the pressure. Nope, not even the rings of Saturn would provide you with a stable surface to walk on. Bummer.</p>
		                <p><span>Total time: Less than one second each</span></p>
